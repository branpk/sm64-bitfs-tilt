Attempt to show that it's possible to receive upward PU displacement on the pyramid platforms in Bowser in the Fire Sea. It was previously thought to not allow platform displacement at all, but some investigation showed that it did, but it works a lot differently than we're used to and has some quirky math. At first it seemed like it was only possible to receive downward displacement, but it turns out that the math is quirky enough to let us get upward displacement as well.
